# EvanderVoxel 🎮

A multiplayer voxel-based sandbox game built with Three.js and Lua. Think Minecraft meets custom creativity - build, explore, and play together in a procedurally generated world!

## 🎯 Project Goals

This is a summer coding project designed for learning game development, 3D graphics, networking, and collaborative programming. By the end of summer, we'll have a fully functional multiplayer voxel game with custom features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Lua** (5.1 or higher) - for the server
- **Modern web browser** - for the client
- **Basic HTTP server** (Python, Node.js, or similar) - for development

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and setup the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd voxelcraft
   
   # Create directory structure
   mkdir -p client/{js,css,assets/{textures,sounds}}
   mkdir -p server/{lib,modules,data/{worlds}}
   mkdir -p tools docs
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x tools/start-server.sh
   chmod +x tools/start-client.sh
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./tools/start-server.sh
   ```

4. **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   ./tools/start-client.sh
   # Or simply open client/index.html in your browser
   ```

5. **Play!** 
   - Open multiple browser tabs to test multiplayer
   - Use WASD to move, mouse to look around
   - Click to place/break blocks

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Three.js (WebGL) for 3D rendering and game client
- **Backend**: Lua server with TCP/WebSocket communication
- **Networking**: Real-time multiplayer with client-server architecture
- **World**: Procedural chunk-based generation with persistence

## 🎯 Custom Feature Ideas

Brainstorm and implement your own unique features:

### Potential Custom Features
- **Magic Blocks**: Blocks with special properties (teleporters, gravity blocks)
- **Mini-Games**: Built-in parkour courses, puzzles, or challenges
- **Custom Mobs**: Friendly creatures, pets, or challenging enemies
- **Weather Effects**: Rain, snow, storms that affect gameplay
- **Vehicle System**: Boats, minecarts, or flying machines
- **Farming System**: Crops, animals, and food mechanics
- **Economy System**: Trading, shops, and currency
- **Territory System**: Claim and protect your builds
- **Seasons**: World changes over time with different seasons

### Technical Challenges
- **Shaders**: Custom visual effects and lighting
- **Procedural Structures**: Automatic building generation
- **AI Systems**: Smart NPCs or automated helpers
- **Physics Engine**: Advanced physics for complex interactions
- **Modding API**: Allow external modifications

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience with:

- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, WebGL, lighting, textures, shaders
- **Game Development**: Game loops, physics, collision detection
- **Networking**: Client-server architecture, real-time communication
- **Data Structures**: Spatial data structures, chunk systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Frustum culling, LOD, batching
- **Software Architecture**: Modular design, separation of concerns
- **Version Control**: Git workflows, collaborative development

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### Code Organization
- Keep client and server code completely separate
- Use modular design - each file should have a single responsibility  
- Comment your code well for future reference
- Test multiplayer features with multiple browser tabs

### Performance Considerations
- Only render chunks that are visible to the player
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Batch similar rendering operations together
- Profile performance regularly

### Debugging
- Use browser developer tools for client-side debugging
- Add comprehensive logging to the server
- Test with multiple clients regularly
- Keep a development journal of issues and solutions
